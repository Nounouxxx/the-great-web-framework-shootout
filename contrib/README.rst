Synopsis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The contrib directory is an entry point for additional test code to be made
available for benchmarking. Its purpose is to make it easy for 3rd parties to
provide test apps that can easily be compared to the "officially supported" test
code included in the repository.

Please see the `Wiki Page`_ for more information, as well as instructions on how
to bundle a contrib test package.
